# Meetup Door Check

2/2016 Meetup Hackathon project

### get started

* clone repo
* `npm install` (need npm >3 and node >4)
* `open ios/peeps.xcodeproj/`

To run on device, not simulator, open AppDelegate.m and uncomment
`//jsCodeLocation = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];`

React stuff is mostly happening in /components/scan.js
